# ferrovgl-embedded

**Placeholder.** This crate will hold the adapters that flush a ferrovgl
display into an `embedded_graphics::DrawTarget` and turn `embedded-hal`
inputs into LVGL input devices. They are planned for ferrovgl 0.2; version
0.1.0 contains no API.

Part of [ferrovgl](https://github.com/jamongadejoa28/rLVGL) (independent project, not affiliated with
LVGL LLC). API documentation: <https://docs.rs/ferrovgl-embedded>.

It is published so that the `embedded` feature of the
[`ferrovgl`](https://crates.io/crates/ferrovgl) umbrella crate resolves. Until
0.2, drive a display with a `ferrovgl_core` flush callback and the
`ferrovgl-draw-sw` renderer directly.
